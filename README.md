# Music-artist-web-app



1)what was the theme you chose? The theme/artist that I chose was Masego.

2)How did you pick your searches to fit the theme? I just have the searches randomly show all of Masego songs and the name of the song as well.

3)What are at least 3 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them? Trying to get genius to work, I was having trouble getting the information from genius to show up on my web app. I was also having trouble getting the twitter feeds, I didn't understand how i was supposed to get the twitter feeds onto my web app. Doing the git commands was so stressful for me, I would always type the wrong words in or I would forget something in the command. I looked up the problems that I faced as well as ask my classmates for help and I also went back over the slides.

4)What would you do to improve your project in the future? What I would do to improve my project in the future is to add more CSS code to make my app look professional/fancy. Also I would try to get the song lyrics to show on the page as well.
